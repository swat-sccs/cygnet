==================
TODO - SCCS Cygnet
==================

Chores
- On logout redirect to homepage with a message via the messages framework saying that the logout happened.
- Add an 'excluded fields' category in settings_base.py, which will determine
  which fields a user wants not to show up.
- Test on: recent Chrome, Safari, & Firefox (maybe IE 8+ and Opera too) ***
- Exclude phone and middle fields from searching/JSON-generation?
- Ensure that handling of names with apostrophes/hyphens works correctly
- Consider trying to move 403-stuff into the .htaccess file, though make
  sure it doesn't keep Google from crawling us (so maybe use redirects)
- Actually remove all the old symlinks to alternate.jpg now that we're doing
  the check to see if the file exists instead
- Fix all the 2014 photos that use a different alternate image
- Finish cleaning up the code (Python and JS), parcel out methods better
- Mention quoting features in the advanced help section
- Fix XSS vulnerability in rendering unsanitized search terms in results
- Update cygnetadmin script to do the right thing w/ new photo management
- Use json2.js or JQuery as a backup JSON parser in case we're in IE7
- Fix search box rendering issues in Opera 10.5? Grid refering in FF 4?
- Run HTML and CSS through the W3C validator service

RFEs
- Include directory of off-campus students and abroad students (requires some
  degree of cooperation from housing)
- Use AJAXified URL updating (with hash component) to allow bookmarking again
- Allow clicking on photos as "mailto:" links
- Indicate when housing data was last updated on front page?
- Predict sizes of images to prevent "jumping" as images load
- Integrate new backend with cygnetadmin script, i.e. have cygnetadmin use
  backend.py to query the directory file somehow
- Add easter eggs, e.g. an embedded youtube video if you search 'rick astley'
- Add query string to image file calls so we can avoid caching problems

Pipe dreams
- Make queries execute faster
  - Find some way to speed up JSON parsing on the client side
  - Store data in a faster-to-read format? Database? cPickle?
  - Faster way to filter?
- Make the results display area prettier
  - Use JQuery to animate display of results
  - Get table to be more compact somehow (text smaller, repositioned?)
  - Offer multiple display options? E.g. photos vs. text-only
  - Sort into multiple columns more fluidly based on window width
  - Standardize photo sizes more, lock sizes of grid contents more
- Find a way to minimize caching of cygnet photos (i.e. instant refresh when
  we change a photo) without forcing a re-download every time
+ Build a mobile version of the Cygnet with larger logo/text field, less text,
  results display optimized for small-width screens
+ Build platform-specific Cygnet apps (iOS, Android)
- Add a "did you mean?" feature that tries to find approximate results if the
  search as entered returned 0 results.
- Implement a suggestions feature for Chrome tab-to-search
  - See: http://www.chromium.org/tab-to-search
