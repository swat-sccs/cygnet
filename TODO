==================
TODO - SCCS Cygnet
==================

- Find a way to minimize caching of cygnet photos (i.e. instant refresh when
  we change a photo) without forcing a re-download every time
- Actually remove all the old symlinks to alternate.jpg now that we're doing
  the check to see if the file exists instead
- Consider trying to move 403-stuff into the .htaccess file, though make
  sure it doesn't keep Google from crawling us (so maybe use redirects)
- Ensure that handling of names with apostrophes/hyphens works correctly
- Fix cygnet to exclude phone and middle fields from searching/JSONifying
- Find a way to speed up JSON processing for large queries
- Migrate setup to Django instead of PHP?

- Test on: Safari 3+, Opera 9+, IE 7+, Firefox 3+, Chrome 5+ ***
- Display detailed execution time of query (for debugging, maybe as feature?) **
+ Make queries execute faster ***
    * Avoid using XML? Or make it faster and lighter... ***
	- Store data in a faster-to-read format? Database? cPickle?
    - Only reread directory file when it's been updated since the last query (or when code is updated)
    - Faster way to filter?
- Don't use symbolic links for missing photos (allows caching of alternate.jpg, less confusing) **
- Make results more compact somehow (text to right of photos, smaller text/photos?) **
- Include directory of off-campus students and abroad students **
- Use AJAXified URL updating (with hash component) to allow bookmarking of search terms *
- Allow clicking on photos as "mailto:" links *
- Show 7 digit phone numbers with a dash in them *
- Sort into multiple columns intelligently (i.e. based on width of browser window) *
- Predict size of image to prevent "jumping" as images load *
* Collapse libXML.js & livecygnet.js into "cygnet.js"
- PHP-ize frontend more (automate copyright logo, etc.)
- Use JQuery to animate display of results
- Offer multiple display options? E.g. photos vs. text-only
- Standardize photo sizes more, lock sizes of grid contents more
- Indicate when housing data was last updated on front page?
- Expand housing abbreviations to full names? (e.g. WHARTN -> WHARTON or Wharton)
