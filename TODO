==================
TODO - SCCS Cygnet
==================

Chores
- Test on: Safari 3+, Opera 9+, IE 7+, Firefox 3+, Chrome 5+ ***
- Exclude phone and middle fields from searching/JSON-generation?
- Ensure that handling of names with apostrophes/hyphens works correctly
- Consider trying to move 403-stuff into the .htaccess file, though make
  sure it doesn't keep Google from crawling us (so maybe use redirects)
- Actually remove all the old symlinks to alternate.jpg now that we're doing
  the check to see if the file exists instead
- Fix all the 2014 photos that use a different alternate image
- Finish cleaning up the code (Python and JS), parcel out methods better

RFEs
- Include directory of off-campus students and abroad students (requires some
  degree of cooperation from housing)
- Use AJAXified URL updating (with hash component) to allow bookmarking again
- Allow clicking on photos as "mailto:" links
- Indicate when housing data was last updated on front page?
- Expand housing abbreviations to full names? (e.g. WHARTN -> WHARTON or Wharton)
- Predict sizes of images to prevent "jumping" as images load
- Integrate new backend with cygnetadmin script, i.e. have cygnetadmin use
  backend.py to query the directory file somehow

Pipe dreams
- Migrate setup to Django instead of PHP? For greater consistency with
  other SCCS websites, easy settings/etc. management, possibility of allowing
  off-campus access via SCCS account sign-in.
- ...Allow off-campus access via SCCS account sign-in.
- Make queries execute faster
  - Find some way to speed up JSON parsing on the client side
  - Store data in a faster-to-read format? Database? cPickle?
  - Faster way to filter?
- Make the results display area prettier
  - Use JQuery to animate display of results
  - Get table to be more compact somehow (text smaller, repositioned?)
  - Offer multiple display options? E.g. photos vs. text-only
  - Sort into multiple columns more fluidly based on window width
  - Standardize photo sizes more, lock sizes of grid contents more
- Find a way to minimize caching of cygnet photos (i.e. instant refresh when
  we change a photo) without forcing a re-download every time
- Build a mobile version of the Cygnet with larger logo/text field, less text,
  results display optimized for small-width screens
- Add a "did you mean?" feature that tries to find approximate results if the
  search as entered returned 0 results.
