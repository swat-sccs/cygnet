This was due to Network upgrades on ITS's side that had unforeseen effects on our services. We have resolved these with the help of ITS now. Thank you for understanding!

	<strong>Privacy Statement:</strong>
	SCCS is committed to protecting students' privacy. This is why we have partnered with
	the college's Information Technology Services (ITS) on this version of the Cygnet: 
	Student data is now supplied via a regularly updated ITS database. If you wish to remove
	or alter your information, you now have additional options which are outlined 
	<a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/?page_id=752">here</a>.
	<br/>
	<strong>Advanced searching:</strong>
	You can do a more specific search by using keywords in the search box.
	An advanced search might look like, "first:matt dorm:mertz",
	which would return everyone named Matt who lives in Mertz.
	The accepted keywords are:
	<ul class="InlineList">
	  <li>first</li>
	  <li>last</li>
	  <li>year</li>
	  <li>email</li>
	  <li>dorm</li>

	</ul>
	<br/>
	 <strong>Important:</strong>The dorm keywords are as follows:
        <ul class="InlineList">
          <li>To search for Alice Paul use <strong>AP</strong></li>
          <li>To search for Mary Lyon use <strong>ML</strong></li>
          <li>To search for David Kemp use <strong>DK</strong></li>
          <li>To search for Strath Haven use <strong>Strath</strong></li>
        </ul>
	All other dorms are searchable by their normal full name.
