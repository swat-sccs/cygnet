This is an information file for the codebase running the SCCS online cygnet.  It explains
the overall structure of the code and how it works at a high level.

Major files:
- index.php
- cygnet.css
- livecygnet.js
- libXML.js
- cygnetxml.py
- config.py
- cygnet.xsd
- directories/
- photos/

Other files are mostly media files used for the frontend of the cygnet.

In more detail:

----------------------
FILE SUMMARIES

index.php

This is the "frontend" page, which defines the structure of the online cygnet webpage, contains
the text for the instructions and other miscellaneous information, and provides the form into
which users can type search queries.  It's also where results are displayed.  It works via AJAX
by calling a function in the livecygnet.js file.

cygnet.css

The CSS stylesheet for the cygnet, defining styles for the inital appearance of the main page
and also for the results that appear once a query completes.

etc...

----------------------
CHANGELOG

Version 3.0

Possible changes:
- Test on: Safari 3+, Opera 9+, IE 7+, Firefox 3+, Chrome 5+ ***
- Display execution time of query (for debugging, maybe as feature?) **
- Make queries execute faster ***
    - Avoid using XML? Or make it faster and lighter... ***
	- Store data in a faster-to-read format? Database? cPickle?
    - Only reread directory file when it's been updated since the last query (or when code is updated)
    - Faster way to filter?
- Don't use symbolic links for missing photos (allows caching of alternate.jpg, less confusing) **
- Make results more compact somehow (text to right of photos, smaller text/photos?) **
- Include directory of off-campus students and abroad students **
- Use AJAXified URL updating (with hash component) to allow bookmarking of search terms *
- Allow clicking on photos as "mailto:" links *
- Show 7 digit phone numbers with a dash in them *
- Sort into multiple columns intelligently (i.e. based on width of browser window) *
- Predict size of image to prevent "jumping" as images load *
- Collapse libXML.js & livecygnet.js into "cygnet.js" *
- PHP-ize frontend more (automate copyright logo, etc.)
- Use JQuery to animate display of results
- Offer multiple display options? E.g. photos vs. text-only
- Standardize photo sizes more, lock sizes of grid contents more
- Indicate when housing data was last updated on front page?
- Expand housing abbreviations to full names? (e.g. WHARTN -> WHARTON or Wharton)


----------------------
OLD VERSIONS

Version 2.0
Cygnet is "live" i.e. uses AJAX for requests instead of traditional form submission.

Version 1.0
First online cygnet?
