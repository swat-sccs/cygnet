CHANGELOG

---------------------------------------------------
Version 3.0 - The Never-quite-done Cygnet (pending)

Substantial overhaul of the Cygnet code, both frontend and backend - changes
ranging from file organization to security to speed to aesthetic appeal.

Major changes:

- Switched backend<-->frontend communication from XML to JSON to improve
  page generation and parsing speed.

- Changed backend to check if photo files exist before returning a path to
  them, using photos/alternate.jpg if the file is missing.  (This means we
  can just remove photos files without replacing them with symlinks to
  alternate.jpg, and missing files won't show up as broken images.  Also,
  hiding a photo will take effect immediately - no browser caching delay.)

- Made security improvements to prevent access to hidden photos or to the raw
  Python files (e.g. settings.py with the excluded-users list).

- Reorganized and renamed most code files (cygnetxml.py -> backend.py,
  livecygnet.js -> client.js, config.py -> settings*.py, etc.); moved static
  images into /media and student picture directories into /photos.

- Simplified frontend appearance with much less text and clutter.

Other changes:

- Implemented full support for quoting with both single and double quotes, so
  that e.g. "HAL 3" will only match records with "HAL 3" as a contiguous
  substring of some field, rather than anything with both "HAL" and "3".  To
  explicitly search the address field, one can even do "address:'HAL 3'".

- Added ability to recover gracefully from backend errors (e.g. HTTP 500
  errors or Python exceptions), printing information returned via JSON.

- Replaced old spinner icon with a new one from http://www.ajaxload.info/.

- Added Cygnet-specific logging ability for debugging purposes, which
  on the server defaults to logging to /var/log/cygnet/cygnet.log.

- Minor cosmetic changes, e.g. using 'result' instead of 'results' when only
  one result is returned, etc.


---------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0 - The Live Cygnet

Cygnet becomes "live" i.e. uses AJAX for requests instead of traditional
form submission where you click a button and the page refreshes.

---------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 - The First Cygnet

First online cygnet?
